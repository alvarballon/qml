# QML

part_1 folder contains three files:

1. issyp_mentoring contains the tutorial I created as a mentor for three cohorts of high school students. It provides hands-on problems that increase in difficulty to learn the basics of the gauge-gravity correspondence. The problems are kept at a high-school level, with differential calculus and basic matrix algebra being the most advanced topics required.

2. qt_bloch_sphere is a ipynb Jupyter Notebook created to introduce UWaterloo students to  plotting mixed states in the Bloch Ball. It contains the Python Code to plot the Bloch Ball, and a function that takes density matrices to the corresponding vector in the ball. As an optional advanced topics, the students can explore the effects of quantum channels on mixed state. 

3. quantum_interpretations_essay is a short essay on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. I wrote this as part of a course in the Philosophy of quantum mechanics, obtaining the maximum grade. It hope it shows my interest in the very foundations of quantum theory, as well as my advanced knowledge on the topic.

part_2 contains a Jupyter Notebook which is intended as an introduction to QAOA. The notebook links to a Youtube video, created by me, which provides a high-level explanation of variational quantum circuits and QAOA in particular. The Notebook contains some original code, and some that is drawn and adapted from the PennyLane tutorials, with the objective of walking the user through all the steps of simulating a quantum circuit in Pennylane.
